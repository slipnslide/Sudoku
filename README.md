*Figure 1*.  Animation solving a sudoku puzzle and partially verifying the solution.

[Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes") contains the digits from 1 to 9.


Sudoku Solver done in Phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp was able to complete all 16 boards including the mathematically hardest board possible all benchmarked at under 3 seconds.

All code was done in ruby without the use of classes or instance or global variables.

To run simply clone and run ruby runner.rb.
If you wish to add a board to try simply enter it in string format into the sudoku_puzzles.txt file. EX: 8----------36------7--9-2---5---7-------457-----1---3---1----68--85---1--9----4--
